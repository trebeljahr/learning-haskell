# I am learning HASKELL! 
## This is a small repo, where I play around with a bunch of haskell learning the concepts. 
## In it I will follow the amazing and FREE book learnyouahaskell. You should check it out!
### http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters
I picked this up because I like learning new stuff and I have heard that haskell is one of the languages that really teach how to write functional programs. And I want to learn that, so I am trying to pick up some haskell in the hopes of becoming a better programmer overall. 
## Some cool resources I also found: 
1. ofc the official site: https://www.haskell.org/

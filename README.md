# I am learning HASKELL! 
## This is a small repo, where I play around with a bunch of haskell learning the concepts. 
I picked this up because I like learning new stuff and I have heard that haskell is one of the languages that really teach how to write functional programs. And I want to learn that, so I am trying to pick up some haskell in the hopes of becoming a better programmer overall.

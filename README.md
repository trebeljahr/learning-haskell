# I am learning HASKELL! 
### This is a small repo, where I play around with a bunch of haskell learning the concepts. 
### In it I will follow the amazing and FREE book learnyouahaskell. You should check it out since it is epic.  http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters
I have heard that haskell is one of the languages that really teach (or force?) you to write functional programs. And I want to learn that style of programming. I think that it will make me a better devoper. And I like that thought.  
## Some cool resources I also found: 
1. ofc the official site: https://www.haskell.org/
